# `talkbank-lsp`, Language Server

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-07-07 21:17 EDT

Guidance for Claude Code when working inside `crates/talkbank-lsp/`. Read the
workspace-level `CLAUDE.md` (at the chatter repo root) first; this file layers
**LSP-specific rules** on top of the cross-cutting design rules.

**Cross-ref (root `CLAUDE.md` "CST Traversal Rules"):** the LSP consumes
`talkbank-parser` (the tree-sitter parser), which is driven by the generated
exhaustive typed traversal module (`generated_traversal`: free `extract_*`
functions over a closed `NodeSlot` enum; no hand-walk, no
ERROR-text-classification). LSP diagnostics inherit that parser's recovery-node
handling; do not add LSP-side text-scanning of CHAT content to recover structure.

## What this crate is

A tower-lsp / tokio-based Language Server Protocol implementation for CHAT
files, driven over stdio by LSP clients (editor extensions and any other
LSP-capable editor). The crate is a **thin protocol adapter** over
`talkbank-parser`, `talkbank-model`, and `talkbank-transform`. It owns:

- LSP request routing (`backend/`)
- Incremental document state (`backend/documents.rs`)
- Validation cache (`backend/validation_cache.rs`)
- Per-feature handlers (`backend/features/`)
- Hover / alignment presentation (`alignment/tier_hover/`, `alignment/formatters/`)
- `%gra` dependency-graph DOT rendering (`graph/`)
- Semantic-token generation (`semantic_tokens.rs`)
- Custom `talkbank/*` RPC endpoints for editor clients
  (`backend/features/execute_commands.rs`, `backend/participants.rs`,
  `backend/chat_ops/`)

What it **must not** own: parsing rules, validation logic, alignment
algorithms, CHAT serialization, or any domain state that survives the
current request. All of that lives in the shared crates.

## The hard rule: alignment is in `talkbank-model`

Every cross-tier alignment computation, main ↔ `%mor`, `%mor` ↔ `%gra`,
main ↔ `%pho`, main ↔ `%sin`, main ↔ `%wor`, is implemented **once**, in
`talkbank-model`'s `src/alignment/` tree. This crate consumes that output;
it never recomputes it.

**Concrete guidance when touching any `alignment/`, `tier_hover/`,
`highlights/`, or `graph/` code in this crate:**

- **Projecting a `%gra` relation index** (1-indexed `relation.index` /
  `relation.head`) to a `%mor` chunk → call `MorTier::chunk_at(n - 1)`.
  The returned `MorChunk<'_>` exposes `.kind()`, `.word()`, `.lemma()`,
  `.host_item()`, `.terminator_text()`.
- **Iterating the `%mor` chunk sequence** for any purpose (rendering,
  labeling, counting, matching against `%gra.relations`) → call
  `MorTier::chunks()`. Do **not** hand-roll `for item in mor.items { … for
  clitic in &item.post_clitics { … } }`, that is the exact shape of the
  bug we fixed.
- **Classifying a chunk** for diagnostic or display text → match on
  `MorChunkKind { Main | PostClitic | Terminator }`. Do not inspect
  serialized text (`~`, punctuation) to tell the kinds apart.
- **Going from a `%mor` item to its alignable main-tier word** → read
  `Utterance.alignments.as_ref().and_then(|a| a.mor.as_ref())` and look up
  the pair; do not re-derive the main-tier alignment from counts.
- **Going from a `%gra` relation to its `%mor` chunk** → use
  `gra_alignment.pairs` directly. The pair's `mor_chunk_index` is the
  authoritative 0-indexed chunk position. Only use `gra_relation.index`
  when you specifically want the author's written value (e.g. to flag a
  typo that the validator would already catch with E712).
- **`%pho`, `%sin` alignment** → same principle: use the `AlignmentSet`
  on `Utterance`, not ad hoc counting.
- **`%wor` is not an alignment**: it is a timing sidecar. Read
  `AlignmentSet::wor_timings: Option<WorTimingSidecar>` and call
  `.is_positional()` / `.positional_count()` before any positional zip;
  treat `Drifted { .. }` as "no timing recovery available," not as an
  error. Do not reach for `%mor`/`%pho`-style alignment helpers here.
  See KIB-016.

If you find yourself needing a chunk primitive the model doesn't expose,
add it in `crates/talkbank-model/src/model/dependent_tier/mor/chunk.rs`
(or the analogous location for the tier in question) and delegate from
here. Do not grow a second walker in this crate.

## Three distinct index spaces (do not conflate)

`%mor` and `%gra` involve three index spaces whose confusion is the
single most common source of alignment bugs. Name them explicitly in
variable names, even when their types are still raw `usize`:

| Space | 0- or 1-indexed | Over what | Example source |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Mor **item** index | 0-indexed | `MorTier::items` | `AlignmentPair.target` (main↔mor) |
| Mor **chunk** index | 0-indexed | `MorTier::chunks()` sequence (item mains + post-clitics + terminator) | `GraAlignmentPair.mor_chunk_index` |
| Semantic **word** index | **1-indexed** | Author-written position in a `%gra` relation | `GrammaticalRelation::index`, `GrammaticalRelation::head` |

Rules of thumb:

- Convert 1-indexed semantic positions to 0-indexed chunk indices with
  `word_index.checked_sub(1)`, never `word_index - 1` (which panics at 0
  and silently "works" at higher values).
- `relation.head == 0` is not a chunk; it is ROOT. Guard before indexing.
- If you need to go from a chunk index to a `%mor` *item* (e.g. to reach
  through the main↔mor alignment), use `chunk.host_item()`, do not do
  index arithmetic.
- Until typed indices catch the confusion at compile time, be
  deliberate when handling these three spaces.

## Other LSP-specific rules

- **No panics in request handlers.** Per the workspace rule, plus the
  LSP-specific reason: a panic tears down the server and the client
  usually respawns with stale state. Always return typed errors or empty
  responses with tracing warnings.
- **Degrade gracefully on parse failure.** `ParseHealth` propagates from
  parser into model; if a document is tainted, feature handlers must
  either return empty results or scope their work to the pre-taint
  region. Do not surface validation errors for downstream-tier constructs
  when the main tier itself failed to parse.
- **Incremental reparse is the hot path.** Tree-sitter does the
  incremental work; the LSP must pass the right edit deltas. When adding
  a feature that touches `DocumentState`, verify that the feature works
  after an edit (not just on open).
- **Custom RPC endpoints must be typed.** Every `talkbank/*` command has
  a request and response shape. Use `schemars::JsonSchema` + `serde` on
  the payloads; do not accept `serde_json::Value` into feature code.
- **Don't fabricate alignment when it's missing.** If
  `utterance.alignments.as_ref()` is `None`, return a graceful fallback
  (e.g. "alignment not computed" hover, empty highlights), not a synthetic
  1:1 mapping.
- **Tests go per-feature and must exercise clitic (`~`) cases.**
  Post-clitic handling is the class of bug we keep finding. Every feature
  that touches `%mor` or `%gra` needs at least one test using a fixture
  like `pron|it~aux|be` or `pron|I~aux|will`.
